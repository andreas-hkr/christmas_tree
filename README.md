# Usage:
### Local:
- Clone repo using ```git clone https://github.com/andreas-hkr/christmas_tree.git```
- Run ```python3 main.py```

### Curl:
- Run ```curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreas-hkr/christmas_tree/refs/heads/main/main.py | python3``` in a terminal



**NOTE:** It is *not* a good idea to run a script directly via curl without first reviewing the script.
